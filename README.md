A 150 lines of numpy for Augmented Random Search (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055)

I am definitly impressed by the simplicity and the performance of this algorithm. 
I did not parallelize computations, hence it could be quite less effective than authors' version (https://github.com/modestyachts/ARS).

But my code should be easyer to handle.
